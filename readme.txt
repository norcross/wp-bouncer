Only allow one device to be logged into WordPress for each user.

== Description ==

WP Bouncer will make sure users are logged in from only one device at a time. This should deter people from sharing their login credentials for your site, which is especially good for paid membership sites.

WP Bouncer works by:
* Storing a random "FAKESESSID" for each user when they log in.
* If a user is logged in, on each page load (init hook), WP Bouncer checks if the FAKESESSID stored in the user's cookies is the same as the last login stored in a transient (fakesessid_user_login).
* If not, WP Bouncer logs the user out and redirects them to a warning message.

For Example:
* User A logs in as "user". Their FAKESESSID, say "SESSION_A" is stored in a WordPress option.
* User B logs in as "user". Their FAKESESSID, say "SESSION_B" is overwrites the stored WordPress option.
* User A tries to load a page on your site, WP Bouncer catches them and logs them out, redirecting them to the warning message.
* User B can browse around the site as normal... unless...
* User A logs in again as "user". Their FAKESESSID, SESSION_A_v2 is stored in the WordPress option.
* Now user B would be logged out if they load another page.

Improvements:
* Settings page to choose where users are taken after being bounced.
* Keep track of how many bounces there are and lock the account down if there are so many in a small time frame.
